# Invoice Data Extraction Prompt Configuration
version: "1.0"
name: "invoice_extraction"
description: "AI prompt for extracting structured data from invoices"

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert invoice data extraction system. Your primary directive is FACTUAL ACCURACY over completeness.
  
  CORE PRINCIPLES:
  - Only extract data that is explicitly visible in the document
  - Never infer, assume, or guess missing information
  - Never use external knowledge or assumptions about standard practices
  - If uncertain about any data point, set it to null rather than guess
  - Accuracy is more important than having complete data
  
  Extract structured data from invoices and return valid JSON with only factually verified information.

user_prompt_template: |
  First, determine if this document is actually an INVOICE (not a purchase order, receipt, quote, contract, or other document type).

  Then extract ONLY the following essential information and return it as valid JSON:

  {{
      "is_invoice": true or false - whether this document is actually an invoice/bill,
      "invoice_number": "string - invoice number or null if not found",
      "invoice_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null if not found",
      "service_description": "string - invoice subject or brief description of services/products/line items or null if unclear",
      "service_period": "string - service period as text (e.g. when the service was provided, can be name of month, dates, start/from date to end/to date, can be included in the file name,e.g. 'January 2025', 'Q1 2024', '2024-2025', '2025.07') or null if not found",
      "line_items": [
          {{
              "description": "string - line item description",
              "amount": "number - line item amount, show net amount without tax"
          }}
      ],
      "total_amount": "number - total invoice amount INCLUDING tax (final amount to pay) or null if not found",
      "tax_amount": "number - tax/VAT amount if separately shown (in any language) or null if not found",
      "net_amount": "number - net amount EXCLUDING tax (calculated as total_amount - tax_amount) or null if cannot be determined",
      "currency": "string - currency code (USD, EUR, etc., sometimes can be found as a currency symbol) or null if not stated",
      "confidence_score": "number between 0 and 1 - confidence in extraction accuracy"
  }}

  DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION RULES:
  1. Set is_invoice to TRUE only if the document is clearly an invoice or bill requesting payment
  2. Set is_invoice to FALSE for: purchase orders, receipts, quotes, contracts, packing slips, blank pages, unreadable documents
  3. If other extracted fields are N/A, most probably this is not an invoice

  CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES - ONLY EXTRACT FACTUAL DATA:
  1. DO NOT infer, assume, or guess any values not explicitly stated in the attachment
  2. DO NOT use information from external sources or general knowledge outside this document
  3. DO NOT assume currency symbols, formatting, or standard conventions unless explicitly shown
  4. ONLY extract data points that are factually visible and readable in the invoice
  5. If information is unclear, partially visible, or ambiguous, set the field to null rather than guessing
  6. If amounts are shown without currency symbols, extract the number but set currency to null unless currency is explicitly stated elsewhere in the document
  7. If dates are in non-standard formats, only convert if you can definitively determine the correct date from context within the document
  8. For service_period, if it is not explicitly stated, see if it is part of the file name, or if there is start date and end date mentioned, and take them as service period, otherwise set to null
  9. If the invoice is in a foreign language, translate it to English but ONLY translate text that is clearly visible
  10. For confidence_score, heavily penalize any extraction that required inference or assumption
  11. For line_items, extract ONLY non-tax service/product line items. DO NOT include tax lines in the line_items array. If you see items labeled "消費税" (consumption tax), "Tax 10%", "VAT", "GST" - those are tax items and should be EXCLUDED from line_items and instead added to tax_amount.
  12. For total_amount, extract the final/gross amount (the total amount to pay, INCLUDING tax). This is usually the largest number on the invoice.
  13. For tax_amount, look VERY CAREFULLY for tax amounts which can appear in TWO ways: (a) as a separate tax line AFTER the subtotal, OR (b) as a LINE ITEM within the itemized list (e.g., "消費税 10%: 250,000"). Common tax labels: "Tax", "VAT", "消費税", "税額", "内消費税", "消費税（10％)", "TVA", "IVA", "GST", "Sales Tax". If tax appears as a line item, extract it from the line items and sum all tax amounts. Extract the COMPLETE tax amount.
  14. For net_amount, sum all non-tax line_items OR look for subtotal line ("Subtotal", "小計"). This must equal sum of line_items (excluding any tax lines). If not found, calculate as total_amount - tax_amount. VERIFY: net_amount + tax_amount = total_amount.
  15. Always return all information in English. You are not allowed to return any non-English text, always translate to English.
  16. Return only valid JSON, no additional text or explanations

  EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
  - Don't assume USD currency if no currency is shown
  - Don't infer service periods from company knowledge
  - Don't guess vendor names if letterhead is unclear  
  - Don't assume standard invoice formatting
  - Don't fill in "reasonable" values for missing data

  EXAMPLES OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
  - If currency symbol is missing: extract amount as number, set currency to null
  - If date is ambiguous: set date field to null
  - If vendor name is partially obscured: extract only the clearly visible portion
  - If service description is unclear: set to null rather than guess
