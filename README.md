# Accruals Automation - Production Guide

## Quick Start

Run the main menu application:

```bash
python main.py
```

This provides a simple terminal interface to access all automation functions.

## Main Menu Options

### üîπ Invoice Processing

**1. Download invoices from NetSuite (RPA)**
- Downloads invoice files from NetSuite bills
- Uses browser automation (Playwright)
- Skips already-downloaded bills automatically
- Saves files to Google Drive folder

**2. Extract invoice data with AI**
- Processes downloaded invoices with GPT-4o Vision
- Extracts: invoice number, date, amounts, service period, etc.
- Supports: PDF, Excel, Word, images
- Skips already-processed invoices automatically
- Parallel processing (default: 3 workers)

**3. Upload extracted invoices to Snowflake**
- Uploads CSV results to Snowflake
- Table: `ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_EXTRACTED_INVOICES`
- APPEND mode (doesn't replace existing data)

### üîπ Accrual Analysis

**4. Run accrual analysis for a month**
- Analyzes PO lines to determine accrual needs
- Interactive month selection
- Skips already-analyzed PO lines for that month
- Uses GPT-4o for decision-making
- Parallel processing (default: 3 workers)

**5. Upload accrual analysis results to Snowflake**
- Uploads CSV results to Snowflake
- Table: `ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_ANALYSIS_RESULTS`
- APPEND mode (doesn't replace existing data)

### üîπ Utilities

**6. Test NetSuite connection**
- Tests RPA browser automation
- Opens browser window to verify login

**7. View logs**
- Shows recent log files
- Location: `logs/` directory

**8. Check Snowflake connection**
- Tests database connectivity
- Verifies credentials

## Typical Monthly Workflow

### Option 1: Full Monthly Process (All Steps)

```
1. Download invoices from NetSuite          ‚Üí Downloads new bills
2. Extract invoice data with AI             ‚Üí Processes new invoices
3. Upload extracted invoices to Snowflake   ‚Üí Saves to database
4. Run accrual analysis for a month         ‚Üí Analyzes PO lines
5. Upload accrual analysis to Snowflake     ‚Üí Saves results
```

### Option 2: Re-run Analysis Only (If PO data changed)

```
4. Run accrual analysis for a month         ‚Üí Only new/changed POs
5. Upload accrual analysis to Snowflake     ‚Üí Append new results
```

### Option 3: Process New Invoices Only

```
1. Download invoices from NetSuite          ‚Üí New bills only
2. Extract invoice data with AI             ‚Üí New invoices only
3. Upload extracted invoices to Snowflake   ‚Üí Append to database
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env file)

Required for production:

```env
# Snowflake
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=PSEDM_FINANCE_PROD
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=EDM_GTM_FPA

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# NetSuite (for RPA)
NETSUITE_URL=https://your-account.app.netsuite.com
OKTA_USERNAME=your_okta_email
OKTA_PASSWORD=your_okta_password

# Google Drive (for invoice storage)
INVOICES_DIR=G:\path\to\your\google\drive\Bills
```

### Performance Settings

**Parallel Workers:**
- Default: 3 workers
- Can be adjusted in main menu prompts
- Higher = faster, but more resource-intensive
- Recommended: 3-5 workers

**OpenAI Rate Limits:**
- GPT-4o: ~10,000 requests/minute
- 3 workers = ~180 requests/minute (safe)
- 5 workers = ~300 requests/minute (safe)

## Output Files

### CSV Results (data/results/)

```
accrual_analysis_results.csv          - Monthly accrual analysis
invoice_extraction_results.csv        - Extracted invoice data
failed_downloads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv  - Failed bill downloads
```

### Logs (logs/)

```
accruals_automation_YYYY-MM-DD.log    - Daily log file
```

All logs include:
- Timestamp
- Module name
- Log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Message

## Snowflake Tables

### Input Views (Read-Only)

```sql
-- PO lines to analyze
PSEDM_FINANCE_PROD.EDM_GTM_FPA.ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_PO_ANALYSIS_INPUT

-- Related bills for PO lines
PSEDM_FINANCE_PROD.EDM_GTM_FPA.ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_RELATED_BILLS_FOR_ANALYSIS_INPUT

-- Bills needing invoice download
PSEDM_FINANCE_PROD.EDM_GTM_FPA.ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_BILLS_TO_DOWNLOAD
```

### Output Tables (Append)

```sql
-- Extracted invoice data
PSEDM_FINANCE_PROD.EDM_GTM_FPA.ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_EXTRACTED_INVOICES

-- Accrual analysis results
PSEDM_FINANCE_PROD.EDM_GTM_FPA.ACCRUALS_AUTOMATION_ANALYSIS_RESULTS
```

## Incremental Processing

All functions are **incremental** - they only process new data:

‚úÖ **Invoice Download**: Skips bills with existing folders
‚úÖ **Invoice Extraction**: Checks Snowflake for processed invoices
‚úÖ **Accrual Analysis**: Checks Snowflake for analyzed PO lines per month

This means:
- **Safe to re-run** without duplicating work
- **Cost-efficient** - only pays for new AI calls
- **Fast** - skips already-processed items

## Customization

### Modify AI Prompts

Edit `prompts/accrual_analysis.yaml` to customize:
- System prompt (business rules)
- User prompt template
- Model (gpt-4o, gpt-5, etc.)
- Temperature (if supported by model)

Example:
```yaml
model: "gpt-4o"
temperature: 0.1
```

Changes take effect immediately (no code changes needed).

### Adjust Business Rules

Edit `src/processors/accrual_engine.py`:
```python
EXCLUDED_GL_ACCOUNTS = ['4550', '6080', '6090', '6092']
MIN_BALANCE_USD = 5000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No invoices downloaded"
- Check: NetSuite credentials in .env
- Check: VPN connection
- Run: Option 6 (Test NetSuite connection)

### Issue: "Snowflake connection failed"
- Check: Snowflake credentials in .env
- Check: Network/VPN
- Run: Option 8 (Check Snowflake connection)

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"
- Check: OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
- Check: API quota/billing

### Issue: "Invoice extraction failed"
- Check logs for specific file errors
- Some files may be corrupted/unsupported
- Failed files logged but don't stop processing

## Support

For issues:
1. Check logs in `logs/` directory
2. Look for ERROR or WARNING messages
3. Check .env file configuration
4. Verify network/VPN connectivity

## Direct Script Execution (Advanced)

If you prefer to run scripts directly instead of using the menu:

```bash
# Invoice Download
python run_invoice_download.py                    # Download from Snowflake
python run_invoice_download.py --test-connection  # Test connection
python run_invoice_download.py BILL_ID            # Download specific bill

# Invoice Extraction
python run_invoice_extraction.py                  # Extract all invoices
python run_invoice_extraction.py --workers 5      # Use 5 workers
python run_invoice_extraction.py BILL_ID          # Extract specific bill

# Accrual Analysis
python run_accrual_analysis.py                    # Analyze all PO lines
python run_accrual_analysis.py --month "Oct 2025" # Specific month
python run_accrual_analysis.py --workers 5        # Use 5 workers

# Upload to Snowflake
python upload_to_snowflake.py                     # Upload invoices
python upload_accrual_analysis_to_snowflake.py    # Upload analysis
```

## Production Best Practices

1. **Run monthly** after PO/bill data is updated in NetSuite
2. **Review CSV results** before uploading to Snowflake
3. **Monitor logs** for errors or warnings
4. **Keep .env file secure** (never commit to git)
5. **Backup results** before re-running analysis
6. **Use default workers (3)** unless you need more speed
7. **Close browser** when running RPA downloads

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share or commit:**
- `.env` file (contains credentials)
- API keys
- Snowflake passwords
- Okta credentials

‚úÖ **Safe to share:**
- Python code
- YAML configuration files
- CSV results (after removing sensitive data)
- Logs (after removing credentials)
